<h2>About this Character</h2>
<p>The Mystery Gang consists of 5 members. Fred Jones, Shaggy Rogers, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley and the most iconic character, Scooby Dooby Doo. They live in Crystal Cove, a place that is "haunted", so the city gained a lot of publicity for the supernatural attacks. They are all mystery solvers that solve the attacks of the other worldy beings. Suprisingly, most of the attacks are actually just guys in rubber suits. Sometimes it might actually be something sinister. </p>

<h2>What they can teach us?</h2>
<p>Fred has shown us to always be prepared and to have plans as seen when he comes to the rescue in many ocasions. Shagggy and Scooby are always lighthearted and fun and they're very flexible with helping The Gang catch the '"monster". Daphne has shown to be patient, kind, gentle and the glue that holds the Mystery Gang together. Velma is very smart and knowledgable and is there to provide obscure information and most of the time she figure out who the perpetrator is before the others. Velma doesn't believe in the supernatural beings that attack her home. </p>
